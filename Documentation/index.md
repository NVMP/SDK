# NV:MP SDK Documentation


## Getting Started
You can open up the NVMP.ExampleServer for a quick, but sort of verbose, game server plugin you can play around with. It represented the first EDEN tests, and has been (for the most part) kept up to date alongside our main server development.

## Development
The SDK API is prone to quite quick changes as we keep getting the API and NV:MP server on it's feet. This documentation may change over time, or may temporarily go out of date. Always check the Discord for development logs for notable changes.
